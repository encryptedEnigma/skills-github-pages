Wrestler’s size that surprised you in real life?
Question

Who are some of the wrestlers’ that shocked you based on their real life physique?

For me it was Kane in ‘99 and ‘01. Man, that dude was a monster. He dwarfed everybody else and was built like a straight tank. He looked like he was crafted out of straight muscle and super tall. I wouldn’t want someone like him upset at me at all.

Then i saw Lesnar in ‘03 , when he face HHH at mania and raw a few years back and same thing. Monster. The man’s chest and back is huge and wide. He was also scary fast and had explosive strength with the ease in which he manhandled guys.

I also saw Omos at the airport from a distance once and that dude made everybody else look like toddlers. I could only imagine up close how much smaller he’d make people look.
