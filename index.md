A couple of years ago in the IWC it was very common for fans to fantasy book every wrestler, show, character etc and come up with most wildest and stupidest ideas that would make Vince Russo blush with so many swerves and outlandish characters that made no sense in kayfabe. However nowadays it’s rare to find it on Reddit and and most forums with people shutting it down and calling them idiots and trolls and are now focused on logical booking and long term storytelling and making sure it’s the right decision.

Might be nostalgia talking but I kinda miss the craziness of the IWC storylines and people taking them so seriously like some kind of inside joke. Now it’s too normal and with people trying to be so smart and having the right answer. It brought out some interesting discussions and wrestling wasn’t taken so seriously.
